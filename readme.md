# Distributed Systems
Projects made during Distributed Systems course at AGH UST.
1. [Graphs](DS1) - check which nodes can act as initiators (can reach all other nodes).
2. [Ricart-Agrawala algorithm](DS2) - symmetric algorithm for mutual exclusion in distributed systems with graph topology.
3. [Raymond's algorithm](DS3) - token based algorithm for mutual exclusion in distributed systems with tree topology.
4. [Token base algorithm](DS4) - mutual exclusion in distributed systems with ring topology.
5. [Mitchell-Merritt algorithm](DS5) - edge chasing handling deadlock detection algorithm for distributed system.
